## Gap Analysis

### Capabilities without documentation (prioritize these)
| Capability | Domain | PM Owner | Priority for Documentation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------------------------|--------|
| | | | [High / Medium / Low] | [Why this should be documented — e.g., "PM leaving team", "upcoming investment", "frequent support tickets"] |

### Capabilities without clear ownership
| Capability | Domain | Last Known Owner | Action Needed |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| | | | |

## Documentation Progress

**Quarterly targets**:
- Each PM documents 2-3 Capability Records per quarter
- Prioritize: near-term investment candidates, underperforming capabilities, knowledge-flight-risk capabilities

| Quarter | Target | Completed | PMs Contributing |
